# [Personal portfolio](https://donjosef.github.io/personal-portfolio/)

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio which includes some of my projects built with vanilla Js and React. Built from scratch using html, sass(which is compiled to regular css thanks to gulp) and js. The main animations(those related to scroll) are handled with javascript. The site is fully responsive and it has been built with mobile first approach for a better scalability. It uses particles.js for a nice and elegant animated background on the header.
